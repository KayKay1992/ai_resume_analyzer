Resume Feedback Page Integration - Explanation

1. New Route: `app/routes/resume.tsx`
	- Added a new page to display detailed feedback for a specific resume upload, accessible via a dynamic route (e.g., `/resume/:id`).
	- Fetches resume data (PDF, image, and AI feedback) from cloud storage and key-value storage using the unique resume ID.
	- Uses Zustand's `usePuterStore` to access cloud storage (`fs`) and key-value store (`kv`).
	- Loads and displays:
	  - The uploaded resume as a PDF (with download/view link).
	  - The generated image preview of the resume.
	  - AI feedback, including summary, ATS score, and detailed suggestions.
	- Redirects unauthenticated users to the login page.

2. UI Components:
	- Integrates three new/reused components for modular feedback display:
	  - `Summary`: Shows a summary of the AI's feedback.
	  - `ATS`: Displays the ATS (Applicant Tracking System) score and improvement tips.
	  - `Details`: Provides detailed feedback and suggestions.
	- These components receive the parsed feedback object as props and render the relevant sections.

3. Data Flow:
	- On mount, the page loads resume metadata from key-value storage (`kv.get('resume:{id}')`).
	- Fetches the actual PDF and image files from cloud storage (`fs.read`).
	- Parses and displays the AI feedback stored with the resume.
	- Handles loading states and fallback UI (e.g., loading animation if feedback is not yet available).

4. Navigation:
	- Includes a navigation bar with a back button to return to the homepage.

5. Purpose:
	- This page allows users to review their uploaded resume, see a visual preview, and read actionable AI-powered feedback to improve their job application.
