PDF-Image Conversion, Cloud Storage, Key Value Storage & AI Feedback - Explanations

1. PDF-Image Conversion (`app/lib/pdf2img.ts`):
- Implements a utility to convert the first page of a PDF file to a high-quality PNG image using PDF.js.
- Dynamically loads the PDF.js library and configures it to use a local worker (`/pdf.worker.min.mjs`) for compatibility.
- Handles errors robustly, returning a result object with either the image file and URL or an error message.
- Used in the upload flow to generate a preview image of the uploaded resume.

2. Cloud Storage Integration (`app/lib/puter.ts`):
- Centralizes all Puter.js API interactions (auth, file system, AI, key-value) in a Zustand store for global state management.
- Provides methods for uploading, reading, writing, and deleting files in the cloud via Puter.js (`fs` object).
- Used to upload both the original PDF and the generated image to cloud storage, returning file paths for later use.

3. Key Value Storage (`app/lib/puter.ts`):
- Exposes methods to set, get, delete, list, and flush key-value pairs in Puter.js (`kv` object).
- Used to store and update resume analysis data (including file paths, job info, and AI feedback) under a unique key for each upload.

4. AI Feedback Integration (`app/lib/puter.ts`):
- Provides methods to interact with Puter.js AI features, including chat, feedback, and image-to-text (`ai` object).
- The `feedback` method sends the uploaded resume and job description to the AI model (Claude 3 Sonnet) for analysis.
- The AI's response is parsed and stored in key-value storage, making it available for later retrieval and display.

5. Upload Flow (`app/routes/upload.tsx`):
- Handles the user upload form, file selection, and submission.
- On submit: uploads the PDF, converts it to an image, uploads the image, stores metadata in key-value storage, requests AI feedback, and updates the stored data with the feedback.
- Provides real-time status updates and error handling throughout the process.

These changes modularize and robustly implement the core features of PDF-to-image conversion, cloud storage, key-value storage, and AI-powered feedback for the resume analyzer app.
