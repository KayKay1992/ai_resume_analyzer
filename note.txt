react-router.config => The file react-router.config.ts exports a configuration object for React Router. Here’s what it does:

It imports the Config type from @react-router/dev/config.
The exported object sets configuration options for React Router.
The key option here is ssr: true, which means server-side rendering (SSR) is enabled by default. If you want to use Single Page Application (SPA) mode instead, you would set this to false.
The satisfies Config part ensures the object matches the expected Config type.
This file is used to control how React Router behaves in your project, especially regarding rendering mode.

package installed.
1. we install animate-css using this command npm i -D tw-animate-css to animate our css.
2 we installed clsx, tailwind-merge, pdfjs-dist, zustand packages using this command  npm i clsx tailwind-merge pdfjs-dist zustand.

Here’s what each of those packages does:

clsx: A utility for conditionally joining CSS class names together. It helps you build dynamic className strings in React and other frameworks.

tailwind-merge: Merges Tailwind CSS classes intelligently, removing duplicates and resolving conflicting classes. Useful when you want to combine multiple className sources.

pdfjs-dist: The official distribution of Mozilla’s PDF.js library. It allows you to render and work with PDF files directly in the browser using JavaScript.

zustand: A small, fast, and scalable state management library for React. It provides a simple API for managing global or local state in your application.
